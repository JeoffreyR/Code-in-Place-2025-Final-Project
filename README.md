My Code in Place 2025 Final Project - Cryptocurrency Correlation Tool

Project Description:

# Cryptocurrency Correlation Tool.
    This program measures how much two cryptocurrencies move in relation to each other.
    But it is not just for crypto, you can use it with stocks, currencies, or any assets
    you are interested in comparing. Just pick the assets you want to analyze, and the
    program will show you how closely their prices follow each other over time. All the
    data you need is out there, and this tool makes it easy to spot patterns and connections
    in the markets you care about.

    I want to clarify that the idea behind this project is not entirely original. There
    are already many excellent sources available that compare assets in great detail.
    My goal here is to recreate some of that information using Python, as a fun and
    educational exercise. I hope this project serves as a useful starting point or
    inspiration for others exploring data through code.

# Additional Python libraries to get this program running.
    os (lets Python interact with native OS)
    requests (for http requests to web servers)
    pandas (library of data structures that analyze and handle data)
    matplotlib (for plots, graphs, charts)

# Future Enhancement.
    Some really exciting stuff, like using machine learning models to predict price trends from
    correlated assets.

# Programming Bugs.
    I have poured a lot of time and effort into building this program, but I am only human and
    so is my code! Despite my best efforts, there may still be a few bugs lurking around. If you
    run into any issues, please let me know so I can make things better. Thanks for your
    understanding and support!

# Real world use.
    Investors use the correlation between assets to diversify their portfolios and hedge against
    risk. Think of it this way: an asset that closely mirrors the market will likely lose value
    in a recession. However, something with low or negative correlation might actually gain value
    during that same period.

# How to Use This Program. Think of the Main Menu as "Steps"

    Step 1: Display this help
    Step 2: Choose Cryptocurrencies
            Select the cryptocurrencies you want to compare. This step runs automatically the
            first time you use the program.
    Step 3: Enter Historical Days (Optional)
            Input the number of past days to include in your comparison. You can skip this step
            if you want to use the default setting.
    Step 4: Retrieve Price Data (Required)
            Run this step to download the latest price data for your selected cryptocurrencies.
            This is essential for generating accurate comparisons.
    Step 5: Plot Chart
            View a visual chart of the price data for easy comparison and analysis.

    Finally, to compare different cryptocurrencies, repeat steps 2 through 5

# To Code in Place (2025).
    I am truly grateful to Code in Place and my section leader Zulfiqar Ali Mir, for creating
    such an engaging and supportive learning experience that made my first encounter with Python
    both enjoyable and inspiring.
